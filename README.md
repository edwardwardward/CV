## Edward Ward

Full stack junior web developer. Currently attending Makers Academy after a growing interest in coding brought on by working as an analyst at a global Startup Accelerator. Having grown from an amateur coder, I've now become fully confident to perform excel on a professional level & believe my experiences before coding will only help me succeed.

In addition to what I've learnt at Makers I've also independently learned Python and been inspired by blockchain & digital currencies to learn the native language of Ethereum: solidity.
