## Edward Ward

Full stack junior web developer. Just graduated Makers Academy after a growing interest in coding brought on by working as an analyst at a global Startup Accelerator (Startupbootcamp). I've got a focus on Blockchain and have been researching the space for over a year - My Makers final project was a full stack Ethereum Dapp

addition to what I've learnt at Makers I've also independently learned Python and been inspired by blockchain & digital currencies to learn the native language of Ethereum: solidity.
