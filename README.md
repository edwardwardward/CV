## Edward Ward

Full stack junior web developer. Currently attending Makers Academy after a growing interest in coding brought on by working as an analyst at a global Startup Accelerator. Having grown from an amateur coder, I've now become fully confident to perform excel on a professional level & believe my experiences before coding will only help me succeed.

In addition to what I've learnt at Makers I've also independently learned Python and been inspired by blockchain & digital currencies to learn the native language of Ethereum: solidity.

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker
Experience as a business analyst where I made decisions that were often based on incomplete information. e.g. using data to determine the correct product mix for Amazon Prime Now.   
#### Quick Study
Lots of experience in learning new concepts & languages. While at Startupbootcamp I regularly did deep dives into new technologies to report on potential startups. 
#### Adaptable
Experienced many different working environments & culture with people from different backgrounds
#### Team-Player
Enjoy working in small teams, comfortable in both leadership and "team-player" positions. I've previously led a small team of 5 remotely on a project at Amazon.
#### Works Well Under Pressure
Not phased by tight deadlines, am willing to put in the extra effort to get the work done
